Leverage large language models to offer suggestions for your paper and help you better prepare for submission! This tool leverages LLMs to conduct in-depth analysis of AI papers from multiple perspectives and fine-grained levels, and generate structured review reports. [‰∏≠ÊñáREADME](./README_zh.md)

## üöÄ Feature Highlights

Supports the parsing of papers in .pdf/.md/.tex formats, and conducts fine-grained analysis and criticism of paper work from multiple perspectives such as:

- Research Motivation
- Methodology Effectiveness/Soundness
- Experiments

It generates a critic report in .md format.


## Quick Start

1. **Installation**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIPaperCritic.git
    
    pip install docling openai
    pip install --upgrade 'volcengine-python-sdk[ark]'
    ```


2. **Prepare the Paper**
   Put the paper to be reviewed into the `data/papers/` directory. 

   (Visit [here](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/AI-ModelScope/docling-models/files) to download docling-models if you need to convert pdf to md. Unzip the downloaded models under `model/`.)
   
3. **Config**
   
   Specify relevant hyper-parameters in `util.py`:
   
   ```python
   API_KEY = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"
   BASE_URL = "YOUR OPENAI BASE URL"
   MODEL_NAME = "OPENAI MODEL NAME"
   
   reviewer_role = "openai"  # select from ["doubao", "openai"]
   language = "cn" # select from ["en", "cn"]
   ```
   
4. **Run the Review**

   ```bash
   python main.py --file-path "../data/papers/example.md"
   ```


##  Contribution

You are welcome to participate in the optimization in the following directions:

1. Prompt Engineering Optimizationüîß
   - **Improve the review question templates** in `prompts/` to enhance the professionalism of the review.
2. Multi-Model Supportüåê
   - Add support for **more LLM** inference (e.g. reasoning model)

If this project is helpful to you, please give it a ‚≠ê and follow for updates! Your support is my greatest motivation for continuous optimization! üéâ
