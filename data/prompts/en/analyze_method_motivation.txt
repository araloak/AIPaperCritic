Read the content of the paper and deeply think and analyze the following questions in your answer to argue how reasonable the methods adopted in the paper are:
What specific methods or algorithms did this paper use to solve the problem?
How does this paper explain the reasons for adopting this method?
Consider whether the characteristics of this method/algorithm are suitable for solving this type of problem?
Is there a simpler, more intuitive way to solve such problems? If there is, what are the unique advantages of the methods adopted in the paper?

Take into account all the above issues to ultimately form your summary of the motivation for the method/algorithms used in the paper.
