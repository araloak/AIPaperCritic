Read the content of the paper, and deeply think and analyze the following questions in your response to argue how effective the methods used in the paper are:
Does the method/algorithm of this paper create a new paradigm and fundamentally solve the defects existing in previous work?
The method/algorithm of this paper has it been significantly and stably improved compared to baselines in various scenarios in the experiments?
Did this paper use this method to obtain some findings that break common sense in the experiment or verify some important hypotheses with experiments?
Does the method/algorithm of this paper face significant costs in other aspects while solving the research problems it faces (such as time and space occupation)?

Consider all the above issues and finally form your analysis and summary of the effectiveness of the methods/algorithms used in the paper.
