You need to consider the following aspects to evaluate whether the writing of the paper is easy for readers to read:
The logical consistency of the paper's writing, such as whether each section has a clear division and explanation of its logical relationship with other chapters?
Each new module's design has detailed step-by-step explanations and design concept descriptions?
Does the paper consistently describe the problem it aims to solve? Are there any sections that are overly simplified and difficult to understand, or overly redundant and lacking in information?
4. Are there any grammatical errors in the English sentences of the paper (the grammatical errors should be pointed out)
